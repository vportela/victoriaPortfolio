DOM stands for document object model


no one really understands dom all the way and you dont really need to. 
its probably not quite right but "document" like in "document.innerText" is the dom for all intents and purposes.

learn to read documentation rather than watching videos. most things will have waaaaay more documentation than videos because videos go out of date and just cant hold all of that information.
