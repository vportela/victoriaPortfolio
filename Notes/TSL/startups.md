# why 9/10 companies had issues
## the builder/inventor trap

- they take shortcuts
- they had a great idea, screened the market a little, moved on to the concept of testing (not market feedback).
- got some investors and develop
- predict a short amount of time to develop the product
- realize there is not a profitable market fit


# the better process
## reduce risk to 50/50 with research and business modeling

- ideas, screening and evaluation
- detailed investigation
- concept and testing 
- market strategy
- product development
- market testing
- market entry
