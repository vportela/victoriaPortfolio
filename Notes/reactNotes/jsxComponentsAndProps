JSX looks like HTML but it is not. 

its important to note that you cannot render more than 1 jsx element at a time.

for example having an <h1></h1> and a seperate <p></p> element is not allowed. 
however, if you wrap these two in a <div></div> it is ok.


- User-Defined Components must be Capitalized !!!!!
- Props are set to true by default 
- Spread Attributes

# Components and Props


What is the purpose of having seperate component files? whats the benefit?
- components let you split UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
- lets you focus on one thing at a time
- probably helps you track down oopsies if you are only working on one component at a time
- conceptually components are like JS functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called props) and return React elements that describe what should appear on the screen.


what is a "props argument"?


In the documentation: 
it mentions  that you can use ES6 to define a component. But we are confused on how exactly the example works. because render() is empty. so does props pass in through there? where does it come from?


Always write component names with capital letters, react treats components with lowercase letters as DOM tags.

<div /> is an html tag
but <Welcome /> is a component


if something is gonna be reused multiple times like a comment, or avatar etc it should be a component so it is easy to reuse. Also if it is complicted like a feedstory, comment, or and app it is likely it should be in its own component.

!!!! All react components must be pure functions. you should not be changing the inputs.
