Getters and Setters notes: 

Getters & Setters are used to protect your data when creating classes.

in an instance, a getter returns the value of the instance and the Setter
sets/updates value.

getter gets, setter sets. pretty simple.
They also help with validation but helping you control how variables are accessed and updated
in the code.

First letter of the variable must be capitalized.

public class Vehicle { 
    private String color; 

    //Getter
    public String getColor() { 
        return color;
    }

    //Setter
    public void setColor(String c) { 
        this.color = c;
    }
}


public static void main (String[] args) { 
    Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
    v1.setColor("Red);
    System.out.println(v1.getColor());
}
//outputs "Red"
