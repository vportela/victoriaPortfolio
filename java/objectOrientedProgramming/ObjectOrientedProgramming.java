public class ObjectOrientedProgramming {
    //object oriented programming is taking real objects 
    //that will help you and putting them into the computer
    //an object has attributes and actions
    //so you create an object like a pen, and then use it througout your code
    //to get the result you want. 

    //AI uses objects

    //you can modify objects to be specific, for example two clicky pens, but
    //one is a twisty pen. 

    //when you create objects in programming you only want to give the user
    //access to information they need without the ability to break stuff.
    //Getter gives you the value of something but you cannot directly
    //change the value


    //in oop you combine related variables and functions into a unit called 
    //an object with variables as properties and functions as methods.
    //for example: cars have the propertes make, model, color 
    //and methods like start() stop() move()

    //another example is the local storage in the browser which has a property
    //like length which returns the number of objects in storage and methods like 
    //get item and remove item

    //when you group like things together, it is called encapsulating

    //object oriented programming uses less parameters than proceedural programming
